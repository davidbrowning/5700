in order to draw stuff, change the "mode" that the user is in. 
e.g. treeDrawing mode. (might have lineDrawing, selection, or labelDrawing mode).

only care about mouse down in certain modes. 

 mouse down and mouse up may switch the "mode". 

fundamental theorum of testing: test every line of code. 
 test case examples: given a function f that takes a string s,
  f(string s); 
 need to come up with a subset of interesting paramaters: 
  e.g. s = null
  s = "really long"
  s = "other odd strings"

 test all branches/paths through the code: 
  if(s!= null & s.contains "string") 
  // if this line were in f(), write a test to hit each case (s == null, s != null, s.contains "string", s.!contains "string)

thought experiment: 
 think about how you fill up the gas tank in a car. 
  1. pull up to pump where pump is on the opposite side of the car's input, and pump is relatively lined up to car input. 
  2. get out of car
  3. move towards pay station
  4. follow instructions on pay station (generally last instruction is to choose fuel grade)
  5. open car input
  6. insert pump
  7. pull and lock trigger. 
  (we talked about this idea, and how each persons' "fill car w/gas" algorithm varied slightly.)

For making templates:
 Figure out where the algorithms are the same, 
 Figure out where they are different. 

Go find the "Simple Financial Planning Program" sheet (should be on canvas).
