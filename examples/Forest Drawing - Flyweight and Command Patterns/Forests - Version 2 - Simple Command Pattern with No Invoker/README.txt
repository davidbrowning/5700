This version of the Forest drawing program makes the following enhancements:

	-	Decouple the GUI from the drawing components using a simple Command pattern (one without an invoker)
	-	Convert the TreeFactory to a singleton
	-	Other minor improvement

Adding the Command layer makes takes the control logic out of the GUI and put it in a place that is more easily tested.  Also, the GUIâ€™s logic is simpler.  However, the real motivation for added the extra Command layer will become evident later when we add an Invoker and an Undo feature.
