This version of the Forest drawing program makes the following enhancements:

	-	Extends the application of the command pattern to include an Invoker (an active object)
	-	Other minor improvements

The Invoker further decouples the GUI from the Drawing Components and sets the stage for introducing
"undo" capabilities.
